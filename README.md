# redactor
A JavaScript tool for making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_(artform)" target="_blank">erasure poetry</a> from websites.

### Usage

Copy the contents of `redactor.js` into the Chrome console and hit return. You can then click and drag to delete text.

The `blackout` variable lets you choose whether to blackout text with &#9608;&#9608;&#9608; or whiteout text.

By default, text will be blacked out. However, simply enter `blackout = false` into the console to enable whiteout. Enter `blackout = true` to return to blackout mode.
